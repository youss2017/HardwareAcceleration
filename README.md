<h4>About</h4>
<p>
The purpose of this project is make hardware acceleration more accessible to non graphics programmers.
This API uses Vulkan (min Version 1.0). This API makes using Compute Shaders much easier for tasks such as image processing.
</p>
<h4>Todo:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Logger</li>
    <li>Provide list of supported image formats for selected GPU</li>
    <li>Provide fallback image formats</li>
    <li>Compile Compute Shaders into SPIR-V</li>
    <li>Design System for launching Compute Shaders</li>
</ul>
<h4>HAExample</h4>
<p>
This serves as an example of how to use the API and also as a test unit.
